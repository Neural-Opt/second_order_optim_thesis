\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my thesis supervisor, Moritz Wolter, for his consistent guidance and support throughout this project.
He was always available to answer my questions and provided valuable feedback whenever I needed it.
I would also like to express my gratitude to my friend Christoph Wolff, who always kept me updated with the latest AI news he discovered on Twitter.
